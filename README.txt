To Aster Global:

The files shared in the "INPUT_2024-02-20" folder should replace the input files in your existing "INPUT" directory folder. All other existing files will remain the same.

The files shared in the "OUTPUT_2020-02-19" folder should replace all prior existing files in your "OUTPUT" directory. This is the output folder that will be called in the code if you want to check the outputs.

All R code documents have been updated and should replace all existing scripts.
